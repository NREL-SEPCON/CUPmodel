%PNNL CCC submodel called 'Cup model' Written by Hoon Choi  June 08 2020
%input parameters are as follows. (SP - stationary phase, MP - mobile phase
% Sf = stationary factor = volume ratio of [V_SP]/[V_MP]
% KD = Distribution coefficient ([Conc_SP]eq/[Conc_MP]eq)
% Ncup = number of cup
% Tau = number of turnover time (iterations)
% C0 = injection concentration
% Vinj = Number of cups for injection volume
% Celution = give elution histories of eluent
% X = MP concentration profiles in cells -> using it to EECCC/dual mode
% Y = SP concentration profiles in cells -> collect for EECCC/dual mode

%KD is the partition coefficient = C[SP]/C[MP]
